    <h1>Re:Eileen Dover university apllication</h1>
    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join as at the University of Awesome's science faculty
       to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">Ph.d</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one,in
       the folowing sections.<br></p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accomodate you startin your study with us at ant time,however 
       it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester, the 
       start dates for each one are as follows:<br>
    </p>

    <ul>
     <li>First semester:9 September 2016</li>
     <li>Second semester:15 January 2017</li>   
     <li>Third semester:2 May 2017</li>    
    </ul>

<p>Please let me know if this is ok,and if so which start date you would prefer<br>
                                                                               <br>
You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com "> important university dates</a> on our website</p>
<h3>Subjects of study</h3>
<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty,we have a pretty opem-minded research facility-as long
    as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology.You seem like
    an intelligent,dedicated researcher,and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.
    Saying that,of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows,in order of priority:<br>
</p>
<p>1.Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine,and the health benefits of Resveratol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)<br>
   2.Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&deg;C(86&deg;F),when
   the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3x10<sup>3</sup>increasing to 3x10<sup>4</sup>.)<br>
   3.<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.
</p>
<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,including how long you'd expect the
    research to take,required staff and other resources,and anything else you think we'd need to know?Thanks.
</p>
<h4>Exotic dance moves</h4>
<p>Yes,you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work,I did study exotic tribal dances.To answer your
    question my favourite dances are as follows,with definitions:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
    <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC,a whole village would dance around in a
    a circle like chickens,to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
    </dd>
    <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
    <dd> Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,they used to practice this dance,which
    involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor,and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
    tiny,very rapid movements.One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired
    modern styles such as Twerking.
    </dd>
    <dt>Artic robot dance</dt>
    <dd>An interesting exapmle of historic misinformation,English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
        discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic",stilted movements,being practiced by inhabitants
        of Northern Alaska and Canada.Later on however ut was discovered that they were just moving like this because
        they were really cold.
    </dd>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
